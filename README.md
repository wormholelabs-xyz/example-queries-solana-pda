## Queries Solana PDA PoC

This is a demo of using [Wormhole Queries](https://wormhole.com/queries/) to check ownership of a Solana NFT on an EVM chain.

While this is a fairly simple example of checking the Solana owner of a single NFT, this could be chained with other queries to also:

- Read from another Solana program's PDA which allows Solana wallets to designate an EVM address
- Read the Metaplex metadata for the matching mint
- Read anything that is stored in any account on Solana

Learn more about developing with Queries in [the docs](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/queries/getting-started).

## Contract

The oracle contract at [`./src/OwnerVerifier.sol`](./src/OwnerVerifier.sol) is an immutable [QueryResponse](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/query/QueryResponse.sol) processor, which accepts valid queries for the designated token mint account via `verifyOwner()` and emits an event as long as the token account balance is exactly `1` and the Solana block time is not older than the configured `allowedStaleness`.

### Constructor

- `address _wormhole` - The address of the Wormhole core contract on this chain. Used to verify guardian signatures.
- `bytes32 _mintAddress` - The 32-byte address in hex of the SPL mint account on Solana. Only queries for that account will be accepted.
- `uint64 _allowedUpdateStaleness` - The time in seconds behind the current block time for which updates will be accepted (i.e. `updatePool` will not revert).

### verifyOwner

The `verifyOwner` method takes in the `response` and `signatures` from a Wormhole Query, performs validation, and emits an event.

The validation includes

- Verifying the guardian signatures
- Parsing the query response
- Response includes exactly 1 result
- Response is for the Solana (Wormhole) chain id
- Request commitment level is for `finalized`
- Request data slice is for entire [SPL token account](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/d72289c79/token/js/src/state/account.ts#L68-L81)
- Request PDA 0 is for the program `ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`
- Request PDA 0 has 3 seeds, all of length `32`, where 1 is `TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID` and 2 is the configured `mintAddress`
- Response account 0's owner is `TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`
- Response time is at least `block.timestamp - allowedUpdateStaleness`

This then emits the following event

```solidity
event OwnerVerified(
    uint64 solanaSlotNumber,
    uint64 solanaBlockTime,
    bytes32 owner,
    bytes32 account
);
```

## Tests

### Unit Tests - Forge

[`./test/OwnerVerifier.t.sol`](./test/OwnerVerifier.t.sol) tests the following

- `reverse` method of the contract, which converts the `u64` fields stored in the Solana account from little-endian (Borsch) to big-endian (Solidity)
- `verifyOwner` positive test case, in which submitting a valid query updates the fields accordingly

#### Run

```bash
forge test
```

### Integration Tests - TypeScript

[`./ts-test/mock.ts`](./ts-test/mock.ts) performs fork testing by forking Ethereum mainnet, overriding the guardian set on the core contract, and mocking the Query Proxy / Guardian responses.

#### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci
# Generate bindings
forge build
npx typechain --target=ethers-v6 ./out/**/*.json
# Start anvil
anvil --fork-url https://ethereum.publicnode.com
# Override guardian set
npx @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-cli evm hijack -a 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B -g 0xbeFA429d57cD18b7F8A4d91A2da9AB4AF05d0FBe
```

#### Run

```bash
npx tsx ./ts-test/mock.ts
```

## Deploy

The contract can be deployed with

```bash
forge create OwnerVerifier --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --constructor-args <WORMHOLE_CORE_BRIDGE_ADDRESS> <MINT_ADDRESS_HEX> <ALLOWED_UPDATE_STALENESS>
```

So the deploy corresponding to the above integration test might look like

```bash
forge create OwnerVerifier --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --constructor-args 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B 0xdd7f5ef910be9be4a65464a27a265c4cac70efc81998cfa1ff2ec0893f7be045 1800
```
